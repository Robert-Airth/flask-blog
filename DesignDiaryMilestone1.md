# Design Diary - Milestone 1

This Milestone was quite overwhelming at first. I had no clue how I was going to build a website considering
that I had no idea what numerous terms/ideas were in the first several weeks of class. After a ton of research
and playing with the code for hours to see what would work and not work, I was left with many questions. As the
weeks progressed, I slowly started building the framework in my mind for this Flask stuff is supposed to work
between HTML, Jinja, and Python. At first it seemed redundant because of my lack of understanding between the
difference of a route and a webpage, but as I continued to collaborate with my group members and others outside
of my specified group, I started to get a clear picture of how the Python scripts are managing the html files
when they're being served. I started to understand that HTML language and Python language cannot interact directly,
an intermediate language (Jinja) is needed to "translate" between languages (I hope I'm understanding this correctly
haha). Once I made this conceptual breakthrough, I was able to make significan progress in a short amount of time. 

I honestly was so overwhelmed at first that I felt that putting in a bare-minimum effort would help me retain
my sanity throughout this semester, but once I got my conceptual breakthrough, I found myself spending significant
time trying to make it a good foundation for future development. I am excited to continue refining my website with
the rest of the things I'll learn in my major. I am also excited to use Python more, but I'm hoping future Milestones
won't be as overwhelming.
